this is for people who use IDE's that do not have the latest for C# such as Sublime Text Editor, Notepad++ and others.

To get Started using the C# Code, download this as a zip and extract it, once it is extracted, drag/copy the folder in your project folder called "lib" or create one. after you can open your project in sublime text editor or vscode.

You can start with a simple program, like in visual studio 2022.

if you already have the .NET SDK and Need it. then go here [.NET SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/releases)

if you would like to view all the code, extract and import the folder into VSCode and take a look at it.

Happy Coding!
